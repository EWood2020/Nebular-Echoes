# Nebular Echoes

Part of the "Astral Blossom" series, "Nebular Echoes" captures the delicate intricacy of nebulae, the celestial cradles where stars are born. This generative art piece mirrors the diffused elegance and vibrant colorscapes that characterize these vast clouds of dust and gas suspended in the cosmic ballet of our galaxy.

## Concept
Inspired by the ethereal nature of nebulae, "Nebular Echoes" utilizes algorithmic artistry to represent the fluid and dynamic forms of these astronomical phenomena. With each iteration, the piece evolves, simulating the slow dance of interstellar matter under the gravitational symphony of the cosmos.

## How to View
To explore "Nebular Echoes" in its animated form, visit the provided link which takes you directly to a live rendering of the piece. For those interested in the technical process, the p5.js script responsible for this creation is available within this repository.

## Technical Details
The script uses noise functions and color gradients to depict the dynamic and fluid structures of nebulae. By adjusting parameters such as density, flow, and color, "Nebular Echoes" offers a unique glimpse into the heart of a nebula.
